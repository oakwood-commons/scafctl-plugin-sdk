# Go Conventions

## Struct Tags

Always add JSON/YAML tags on exported structs.

## Error Handling

Always wrap errors with context:

```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to create user: %w", err)
}
```

## Design Principles

- Accept interfaces, return structs
- Keep interfaces small (1-3 methods)
- Define interfaces where they are used, not where they are implemented
- Use constructor functions for dependency injection
- Use functional options pattern (`WithX(val) Option`) for configurable constructors
- Always pass `context.Context` as first parameter for timeout/cancellation control
- No package-level mutable state

## Secret Management

Read secrets from environment variables -- never hardcode.

## Formatting

- **gofmt** and **goimports** are mandatory -- no style debates
- Never use magic strings or numbers; always define constants

## SDK Design

This module is imported by plugin authors. Keep it lightweight:
- No CEL, OpenTelemetry, Cobra, or other heavy dependencies
- Only include code that plugins need (not host-side logic)
- Interface changes are breaking changes -- be careful with `ProviderPlugin` and `AuthHandlerPlugin`
